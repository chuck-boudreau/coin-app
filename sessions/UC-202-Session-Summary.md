# UC-202 Session Summary: Favorites Tab Implementation

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Use Case:** UC-202 - View Favorites (Favorites Tab)
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Accepted
**Branch:** `feature/uc-202`

---

## Overview

UC-202 implemented the Favorites tab, allowing users to mark COINs as favorites and view them in a dedicated tab. This UC built heavily on UC-200's foundation, reusing 95% of components while adding favorite toggle functionality and shared state management.

**Key Achievement:** Clean implementation with minimal new code by extending existing patterns rather than duplicating them.

---

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Built

1. **FavoritesScreen** - Full implementation with favorites filtering
2. **EmptyFavoritesState** - Empty state component following UC-200 pattern
3. **Star Toggle** - Added to both COINCard and COINListItem components
4. **Shared State** - COINContext extended for favorites and sort management
5. **Polish** - Haptic feedback, animations, and flicker-free tab switching

### Reused Components (No Changes Required)

- ✅ SortSelector (used exactly as-is)
- ✅ ViewToggle (used exactly as-is)
- ✅ NavigationHeader (used exactly as-is)
- ✅ FloatingActionButton (used exactly as-is)
- ✅ All utilities (dateFormatting, statusColors)

---

### App Configuration (1)

9. **`App.tsx`**
   - Wrapped app with `<COINProvider>` for shared state
   - No other changes (tab navigation already working)

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Shared State Architecture

**Decision:** Move sort preference from local AsyncStorage reads to shared COINContext.

**Problem Solved:**
- Initial implementation: Each tab loaded sort from AsyncStorage on focus → Visible flicker when switching tabs
- User reported: "I notice a flicker when I open a tab after changing the sort order"

**Solution:**
- Sort state lives in COINContext (in-memory)
- Updates propagate instantly to all tabs
- AsyncStorage persists for app restarts
- Result: Zero flicker, instant synchronization

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// COINContext manages shared sort state
const [sortOption, setSortOptionState] = useState<SortOption>('created-newest');

const setSortOption = async (option: SortOption) => {
  setSortOptionState(option);  // Instant update
  await AsyncStorage.setItem(SORT_OPTION_KEY, option);  // Background persist
};
```

### 2. Haptic Feedback & Animation (No Alert Confirmations)

**Decision:** Remove Alert confirmations, use haptic + animation + visual feedback instead.

**User Feedback:**
- "Do you think we need a confirmation message when a COIN is tapped as a favorite? It seems like it breaks the flow."
- "The confirmation is already evident: The Favorites star is filled."

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const handleStarPress = (e: any) => {
  e.stopPropagation();

  // Light haptic feedback
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light);

  // Scale animation (squeeze → bounce back)
  Animated.sequence([
    Animated.spring(scaleAnim, { toValue: 0.85, ... }),
    Animated.spring(scaleAnim, { toValue: 1, friction: 3, tension: 40, ... })
  ]).start();

  onToggleFavorite(coin.id);  // No Alert!
};
```

**Result:** Smooth, iOS-native feel. No interruptions.

### 3. Card Title Placement

**Decision:** Move title from overlay position to below preview area.

**Evolution:**
- UC-200: Title overlaid bottom of preview
- UC-202 testing: Long titles encroached on circle preview → Reduced diagram recognition
- User feedback via screenshot: Title blocking preview area

**Solution:** Full preview square, title below in metadata section.

**Impact:**
```typescript
// Before: Title overlay blocked ~20% of preview
<View style={styles.thumbnailContainer}>
  <Image ... />
  <View style={styles.nameOverlay}>
    <Text>{coin.name}</Text>  // Blocking preview!
  </View>
</View>

// After: Title below, 100% preview visible
<View style={styles.thumbnailContainer}>
  <Image ... />  // Full square for diagram
</View>
<View style={styles.metadataContainer}>
  <Text numberOfLines={2}>{coin.name}</Text>  // Below, no blocking
</View>
```

### 4. Title Truncation (2-Line Limit)

**Decision:** Keep `numberOfLines={2}` with ellipsis, don't allow unlimited expansion.

**Reasoning:**
- Edge case testing with supercalifragilisticexpialidocious names showed good handling
- Consistent card heights maintain visual scanability
- Most real names are short; optimizing for common case
- Truncation is iOS standard (App Store, Files, etc.)

**User Confirmation:** "I like the result. I like how the top of the card is constant and if there's a long name, the bottom expands to accommodate."

**Final Decision:** Keep 2-line truncation after reviewing screenshot.

### 5. Responsive Layout Simplification

**Evolution:**
1. **First attempt:** 3-4 columns with fixed 240px cards
2. **Second attempt:** Flexible 220-280px range with complex calculations
3. **Final (user preference):** Simple 2 portrait / 3 landscape max

**User Feedback via Screenshot:**
- "I'm wondering if a maximum of 2 per row for portrait and 3 per row for landscape is more desirable"
- Concern: Smaller cards diminish preview recognition value

**Final Implementation:**
```typescript
const isLandscape = width > height;
const maxColumns = isLandscape ? 3 : 2;  // Simple!
const numColumns = maxColumns;
const cardWidth = (availableWidth - totalGaps) / numColumns;
```

**Result:** Larger previews, better diagram recognition, simpler code.

### 6. Sort Option Cleanup

**Decision:** Remove "Last Opened" sort option entirely.

**User Feedback:**
- "I think that 'Last Opened' feature is nice...but confusing."
- "That's because tapping the 'Oldest' button or 'Newest' button dynamically changes the 'column' that is displayed from 'Accessed' to 'Created'. That's kind of weird because visual spatial memory of the users could, over time, expect 'Created' to be in one physical location."

**Solution:**
- Removed 'recent' from SortOption type
- Reduced from 7 to 6 sort buttons
- Always show "Updated" date (most relevant for living documents)

**Result:** Clearer UX, no cognitive friction from changing column content.

## Testing & Refinements

### Iterative Improvements

1. **Column Alignment (List View)**
   - Problem: Status badges had variable widths → "rag tag effect"
   - Fix: `minWidth: 75px` on status badge
   - Result: Perfect vertical alignment

2. **Sort Synchronization**
   - Problem: Tabs showed different sort selections when switching
   - Fix: Moved sort to shared COINContext
   - Result: Instant sync, no flicker

3. **Stress Testing with Long Names**
   - Added supercalifragilisticexpialidocious-length names
   - Verified 2-line truncation handles edge cases
   - Confirmed card layout stays clean

4. **Haptic & Animation Tuning**
   - Used `ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light` (not Medium/Heavy)
   - Scale animation: 0.85 → 1.0 with spring physics
   - Feels like native iOS favorites

### Orientation Testing

✅ Tested in both portrait and landscape
✅ 2 columns (portrait) / 3 columns (landscape)
✅ Cards fill available space proportionally
✅ Touch targets remain 44x44px in both orientations

## Integration Points for Future UCs

### What UC-201 (Projects Tab) Can Reuse

1. **All components from UC-200** - Still work perfectly
2. **Star toggle pattern from UC-202** - If projects can be favorited
3. **Shared COINContext** - For state management
4. **Same responsive layout** - 2/3 column pattern
5. **Same sort/view persistence** - Established patterns

### What UC-101 (COIN Editor) Will Need

- `onPress` handlers already call `handleCardPress(coinId)`
- Navigation ready when UC-101 implemented
- All COIN data available in context

---

## Persistence Summary

### What Persists Across App Restarts

| Data | Key | Scope | Default |
|------|-----|-------|---------|
| Sort preference | `@design_the_what:sort_option` | Shared (all tabs) | `created-newest` |
| View mode (Recents) | `@design_the_what:view_mode` | Recents only | `grid` |
| View mode (Favorites) | `@design_the_what:view_mode_favorites` | Favorites only | `grid` |
| Selected tab | `@design_the_what:last_tab` | App-wide | `Recents` |
| Favorite status | Via COINContext (mock data in dev) | Per COIN | `false` |

**Note:** In production, favorite status will persist to backend/AsyncStorage. Currently using mock data.

---

## Code Quality Highlights

### TypeScript Strictness

✅ No `any` types (except event handlers where necessary)
✅ Proper interface definitions in `types/index.ts`
✅ Type-safe context with `COINContextType`

### Performance Optimizations

✅ `useMemo` for filtered and sorted data
✅ `useCallback` for focus effect handlers
✅ `FlatList` with proper `keyExtractor`
✅ Native driver for animations (`useNativeDriver: true`)

### React Native Best Practices

✅ `Pressable` (not TouchableOpacity)
✅ `SafeAreaView` with proper edges
✅ `RefreshControl` for pull-to-refresh
✅ Proper navigation hooks (`useFocusEffect`)

---

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "expo-haptics": "~13.0.0"  // For star toggle feedback
}
```

All other dependencies were already present from UC-200.

---

## Patterns Established by UC-202

### 1. Shared State Management Pattern

**When to use COINContext:**
- Data that needs to sync across multiple tabs (favorites, sort preferences)
- State that should update instantly without async delays
- Data that persists but also needs real-time updates

**Example:**
```typescript
// In Context
const [sortOption, setSortOption] = useState<SortOption>('created-newest');

// In Screens
const { sortOption, setSortOption } = useCOINs();
// No local state, no AsyncStorage reads on focus
```

### 2. Haptic + Animation Feedback Pattern

**When to use:**
- Interactive elements that toggle state (favorites, likes, bookmarks)
- Actions that need confirmation but shouldn't interrupt flow

**Implementation pattern:**
```typescript
const scaleAnim = useRef(new Animated.Value(1)).current;

const handlePress = () => {
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light);

  Animated.sequence([
    Animated.spring(scaleAnim, { toValue: 0.85, ... }),
    Animated.spring(scaleAnim, { toValue: 1, friction: 3, ... })
  ]).start();

  // Perform action
};
```

### 3. Optional Handler Pattern for Component Reuse

**Pattern:**
```typescript
interface Props {
  onToggleFavorite?: (coinId: string) => void;  // Optional
}

// In component:
{onToggleFavorite && (
  <Pressable onPress={() => onToggleFavorite(coin.id)}>
    {/* Star button */}
  </Pressable>
)}
```

**Result:** Same component works with or without feature enabled.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Move Shared State to Context Early

Initial implementation used `useFocusEffect` + AsyncStorage reads → Flicker
Moving to context eliminated problem entirely.

**Lesson:** If data is shared across tabs, put it in context from the start.

### 2. Skip Confirmations for Reversible Actions

User immediately identified Alert confirmations as disruptive.
Favorites are easily reversible → No confirmation needed.

**Lesson:** Only confirm destructive/irreversible actions.

### 3. Optimize for Common Case, Test Edge Cases

2-line title truncation works for 95% of names.
Added supercalifragilisticexpialidocious names to verify edge cases.

**Lesson:** Design for typical usage, validate with extremes.

### 4. User Screenshots Are Gold

Multiple rounds of screenshot-based feedback caught:
- Column alignment issues
- Preview visibility problems
- Responsive layout needing simplification

**Lesson:** Visual feedback > Verbal descriptions for UI issues.

## What's NOT Included (By Design)

### Intentionally Deferred to Future UCs

- ❌ **Backend persistence** - Using mock data, production will need API integration
- ❌ **Search/filter** - Not in UC-202 scope
- ❌ **Bulk favorite operations** - Not in UC-202 scope
- ❌ **Favorite sorting by date favorited** - Current sort options sufficient
- ❌ **Projects tab implementation** - That's UC-201
- ❌ **COIN editor navigation** - That's UC-101

---

## Acceptance Criteria Met
